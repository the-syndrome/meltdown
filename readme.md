Meltdown is a concept for an isomorphic [imba](https://imba.io) framework with SSR, SPA, and SSG modes. In the current form it's a template. In the future we can develop it into a framework or a better template.

Demo, docs, and community â†’ <https://meltdown.dex.yachts>

Features

+ Client rendering: SPA mode
+ Server rendering: SSR mode
+ Convention routing with `./src/pages`
+ Instant and seemless navigation between pages
+ Dynamic loading data from API

Future & Todo

+ Server-side generation: SSG mode
+ Error pages
+ Markdown pages e.g. `./src/pages/about.md` becomes `/about` page
+ Layouts
+ Other things inspired by vike, next.js, hexo, hugo, astro, nuxt, etc.
