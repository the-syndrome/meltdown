Meltdown is a concept for an isomorphic [imba](https://imba.io) framework with SSR, SPA, and SSG modes. In the current form it's a template. In the future we can develop it into a framework or a better template.

## Deploy

In production, the default script is usually `npm start`, so we followed that convention too. It will build the page routes, transpile the server and client source, and then start the server. This flow will work for most. If you're app is huge, you may want to optimize it.

```sh
npm start # setup, build, and run server process
```
